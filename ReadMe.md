# Museum tour map

## This is an app for anyone that is interested in planning a tour of the museums in San Francisco or for anyone that just wants to know more about them.

## How to:
### 1. Open the index.html file with a browser. There will be a map with multiple markers, by default. The markers mark all the museums in San Francisco (radius:5000).

### 2. Click on any one of the markers. An info window about the clicked museum will appear. It includes a panorama of the museum, the business info and the wiki info (if any) about the museum. To make the browser revert to the default presence of the markers and the map, click the 'Museum' Icon on the right side of the map.

### 3. Click on the 'Search' Icon on the right side of the page to toggle the presence of a panel with a list of museums. Either type in the search box and click 'Search' button/press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or just click a name on the list in the panel. The info window mentioned in Step 2 will appear.
### *Warning: If the typed value does not match any in the list of museums, a pop-up alert will prompt you to recheck your typing. Simply click the 'x' button to close the alert window.*

### 4. Use the â€˜From, To, Travel mode' panel at the top of the page to plan a tour of multiple museums. By selecting a starting point, a destination, and a transportation mode, you will see a highlighted route between two museums and a step-by-step guide about how to travel from one to another. When you are finished, simply click the 'x' button in the top left corner of the guide to close it and to remove the route.

### 5. This app is responsive and can be used on laptops, tablets, smartphones, and some other smart devices.

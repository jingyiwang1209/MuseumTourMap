# Museum tour map

## This is an application for the users who want to visit the museums in San Francisco or who just want to learn the history and the business information about those museums.

## Instructions:
### 1. Open the app with your browsers. You will see a map with multiple markers, by default. The markers mark all the museums in San Francisco (radius:1800).

### 2. You can directly click on any of the markers. Two info windows about the museum will show up afterwards. To revert to the default presence of the markers and the map, click the Museum icon on the right side of the map.

### 3. You can also click the Search Icon on the right side of the page. Once it is clicked, a panel of a list of museums will show up from the bottom. You can either type in the search box and click Filter button or just click a name of the list. The two info windows mentioned in Step 2 will show up.

### 4. By far users have checked out quite amount of information about their interested museums. To revert the app back the original layout, click 'Show All Markers' button on the right corner, then the map will go back to its original status, with all markers on.
### Hint: you can click 'Hide All Markers' to close all the markers if you feel annoyed.

### 5. Users can use the "From, To, Travel mode' panel in the bottom of the page to plan a tour to multiple museums. By choosing a starting point, a end point and a transportation, the map will show you the distance between two museums and a step-by-step guide on how to get to the destination. It is especially convenient for the users who want to visit museums from one to another. Simply click any blank area in the grey panel to close the step-by-step guide and the distance in the map. Also, feel free to drag the map for your best visual experience.

### 6. This app is responsive. Users can use it on laptops, tablets and smartphones. Users of smaller devices may find a sandwich button on the left corner of the screen, which is used for toggling the presence of the navi area to save space. Other panels/windows are still at the similar places as laptops.

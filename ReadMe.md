# Museum tour map

## This is an application for the users who are interested in visiting the museums in San Francisco, California, or just learning the history, and other related information about those museums.

## Instructions:
### 1. Open the app. You will see two areas: a navigation on the left side, and a map on the right side of the page. The navi area lists all the names of the museums in San Francisco (radius:1800). In the map, all the markers that mark those museums by default are turned on. The navi area and the map are in sync with Google server.

### 2. Directly click on the museum name in the list, or type in a museum name in the textbox next to the Filter button then click the button. Either way will initialize a zoomed-in map, only with the marker of that clicked or typed museum inside, which is convenient for users to check out the museum you are interested in.
### Warning: a typed name out of the list will prompt an alert.

### 3. Click the marker in the map. A information window with a panorama image will pop up above the marker. Meanwhile, another information window about more details such as: address, website, business hour, rating, wiki (if any), and so on in the navi area will pop up too. Users feel free to click the website and wiki (if any) links for details about the museum. All of these information are in sync with Google server and Wiki server. Once done reading, click the 'x' to close the windows.

### 4. By far users have checked out quite amount of information about their interested museums. To revert the app back the original layout, click 'Show All Markers' button on the right corner, then the map will go back to its original status, with all markers on.
### Hint: you can click 'Hide All Markers' to close all the markers if you feel annoyed.

### 5. Users can use the "From, To, Travel mode' panel in the bottom of the page to plan a tour to multiple museums. By choosing a starting point, a end point and a transportation, the map will show you the distance between two museums and a step-by-step guide on how to get to the destination. It is especially convenient for the users who want to visit museums from one to another. Simply click any blank area in the grey panel to close the step-by-step guide and the distance in the map. Also, feel free to drag the map for your best visual experience.

### 6. This app is responsive. Users can use it on laptops, tablets and smartphones. Users of smaller devices may find a sandwich button on the left corner of the screen, which is used for toggling the presence of the navi area to save space. Other panels/windows are still at the similar places as laptops.
